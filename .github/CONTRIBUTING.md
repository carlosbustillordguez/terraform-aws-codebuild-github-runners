# Notes for Contributors

Please follow [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

This is a rough outline of the workflow:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually master/main.
- Make commits of logical units (and add tests!).
- Make sure your commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request. The pull request's title must follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Rebase and force-push to your fork's branch as necessary.

Thanks for you contributions!
